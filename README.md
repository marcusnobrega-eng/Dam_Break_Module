# Dam_Break_Module
This is the repository of the Dam Break Module for a Serious Games Approach 
The goal of this repository is to create an open-source tool for 1-D Dam-Break analysis with a serious game approach.

Herein we use the HydroHP 1D model, for more info, see the article:

- Modeling Unsteady and Steady 1D Hydrodynamics under Different Hydraulic Conceptualizations: Model/Software Development and Case Studies

If you have any questions, please first read the manual and reach me out at marcusnobrega.engcivil@gmail.com if you still have issues with the model.
